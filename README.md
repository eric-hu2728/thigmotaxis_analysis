# XY Shoal Analysis
The purpose of this script is to take the XY coordinates generated from ImageJ analysis of 7 dpf zebrafish larvae and convert it into a unitless measure of average inter-individual distance.
The basic process has been written out and given a real-life test run on my master's thesis at NTNU. Results were consistent and successfully demonstrated drug response.
Currently, I'm working on a GUI and CV integration so users don't have to manually output the XY coordinates for each sample.
