# XY Shoal Analysis
The purpose of this script is to take the XY pixel coordinates from an image of zebrafish larvae to calculate an average inter-individual distance.
This simple script was validated in a study on larvla zebrafish response to low-dose DMSO treatment. Wild-type larvae exhibited a shorter mean inter-individual distance (tighter shoal) upon agitation challenge in a petrti dish, whereas FMR1 knockout larvae did not. This phenotype was then recovered with chronic 0.05% DMSO treatment.
Currently, I'm working on a GUI and CV integration so users don't have to manually output the XY coordinates for each sample.
